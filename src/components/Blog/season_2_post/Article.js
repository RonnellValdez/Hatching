                <p>Magical mountain was my season 3 build on the back to bedrock minecraft server. This mountain was inspired by my recent trip to Universal Studios Orlando. I tried to recreate the atmosphere of the Harry Potter portion of the park. I was also inspired by Grian, a member of the Hermitcraft Server on youtube, who built a beautiful render of Gringotts Bank from Harry Potter.
